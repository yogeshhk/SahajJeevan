# 🧘 Life, Happiness & Peace of Mind

* A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought — they must be earned.
* This is such a short and precious life that it’s really important that you don’t spend it being unhappy.
* Happiness is a choice and a skill and you can dedicate yourself to learning that skill and making that choice.
* The most important trick to be happy is to realize that happiness is a choice that you make and a skill that you develop. You choose to be happy, and then you work at it. It’s just like building muscles.
* Happiness is a state where nothing is missing.
* Reality is neutral. Our reactions reflect back and create our world. Judge, and feel separate and lonely. Anger, and lose peace of mind. Cling, and live in anxiety. Fantasize, and miss the present. Desire, and suffer until you have it. Heaven and hell are right here, right now.
* A rational person can find peace by cultivating indifference to things outside of their control.
* The enemy of peace of mind is expectations drilled into you by society and other people.
* Anger is a hot coal that you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it at someone else.
* Caught in a funk? Use meditation, music, and exercise to reset your mood. Then choose a new path to commit emotional energy for rest of day.
* Be present above all else.
* Every moment has to be complete in and of itself.
* You can have the mind or you can have the moment.
* A busy mind accelerates the perceived passage of time. Buy more time by cultivating peace of mind.
* Life hack: when in bed, meditate. Either you will have a deep meditation or fall asleep. Victory either way.
* Meditation is intermittent fasting for the mind.
* Enlightenment is the space between your thoughts.
* You can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it. What is not a good option is to sit around wishing you would change it but not changing it, wishing you would leave it but not leaving it, and not accepting it. It’s that struggle, that aversion, that is responsible for most of our misery. The phrase that I use the most to myself in my head is one word: accept.

# 🏆 Wealth, Work & Entrepreneurship

* Earn with your mind, not your time.
* You’re never going to get rich renting out your time.
* Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep.
* You must own equity to gain your financial freedom.
* Apply specific knowledge with leverage and eventually, you will get what you deserve.
* Play long-term games with long-term people.
* Embrace accountability and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.
* Take business risks under your own name.
* Forget rich versus poor, white-collar versus blue. It’s now leveraged versus un-leveraged.
* If you can outsource something or not do something for less than your hourly rate, outsource it or don’t do it.
* Who you do business with is just as important as what you choose to do.
* If you can’t see yourself working with someone for life, don’t work with them for a day.
* Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists; their beliefs are self-fulfilling.
* Escape competition through authenticity.
* Above “product-market fit” is “founder-product-market fit.”
* I would rather be a failed entrepreneur than someone who never tried. Because even a failed entrepreneur has the skill set to make it on their own.
* Grind and sweat, toil and bleed, face the abyss. It’s all part of becoming an overnight success.
* If you see a get rich quick scheme, that’s someone else trying to get rich off of you.
* If they can train you to do it, then eventually they will train a computer to do it.
* Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you’re retired.
* Forty hour workweeks are a relic of the Industrial Age. Knowledge workers function like athletes — train and sprint, then rest and reassess.

# 📚 Learning & Knowledge

* The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner.
* Your most important skill isn’t even what you majored in or even what you studied, it’s just knowing how to learn. If you have a good grasp of mathematics and if you like to read, there’s nothing you can’t learn on your own.
* Even today, what to study and how to study it are more important than where to study it and for how long. The best teachers are on the Internet. The best books are on the Internet. The best peers are on the Internet. The tools for learning are abundant. It’s the desire to learn that’s scarce.
* One of the most damaging and widespread social beliefs is the idea that most adults are incapable of learning new skills.
* Knowledge is a skyscraper. You can take a shortcut with a fragile foundation of memorization, or build slowly upon a steel frame of understanding.
* Mental models are really just compact ways for you to recall your own knowledge.
* The really smart thinkers are clear thinkers. They understand the basics at a very, very fundamental level. I would rather understand the basics really well than memorize all kinds of complicated concepts I can’t stitch together and can’t rederive from the basics.
* Think clearly from the ground up. Understand and explain from first principles. Ignore society and politics. Acknowledge what you have. Control your emotions.
* Clear thinkers appeal to their own authority.
* Reading a book isn’t a race — the better the book, the more slowly it should be absorbed.
* It’s better to read a great book slowly than to fly through a hundred books quickly.
* Read what you love until you love to read.
* Read the greats in math, science, and philosophy. Ignore your contemporaries and news. Avoid tribal identification. Put truth above social approval.
* If you start with the originals as your foundations, then you have enough of a worldview and understanding that you won’t fear any book.
* Reading is more efficient when at rest. Audio is more efficient when in motion.
* My 1 repeated learning in life: “There Are No Adults.” Everyone’s making it up as they go along. Figure it out yourself, and do it.

# 🧩 Habits, Discipline & Self-Mastery

* The power to make and break habits and learning how to do that is really important.
* Humans are basically habit machines… I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else.
* I think learning how to break habits is a very important meta-skill that can serve you better in life than almost anything else.
* All the benefits in life come from compound interest — money, relationships, habits — anything of importance.
* All the real benefits of life come from compound interest.
* All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.
* You make your own luck if you stay at it long enough.
* Inspiration is perishable — act on it immediately.
* Courage isn’t charging into a machine gun nest. Courage is not caring what other people think.
* Most of the gains in life come from suffering in the short term so you can get paid in the long term.
* All greatness comes from suffering.
* If you’re willing to bleed a little every day, you may win big later.
* Don’t do things that you know are morally wrong. Not because someone is watching, but because you are. Self-esteem is just the reputation that you have with yourself.

# 🧠 Philosophy, Truth & Perspective

* Information is everywhere but its meaning is created by the observer that interprets it. Meaning is relative and there is no objective, over-arching meaning.
* The fundamental delusion — there is something out there that will make me happy and fulfilled forever.
* Desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.
* The problem happens when we have multiple desires. When we have fuzzy desires. When we want to do ten different things and we’re not clear about which is the one we care about.
* People spend too much time doing and not enough time thinking about what they should be doing.
* Don’t take yourself so seriously. You’re just a monkey with a plan.
* If you’re desensitized to the fact that you’re going to die, consider it a different way. As far as you’re concerned, this world is going to end. Now what?
* We’re not really here for that long and we don’t really matter that much. And nothing that we do lasts. So eventually you will fade. Your works will fade. Your children will fade. Your thoughts will fade. This planet will fade. The sun will fade. It will all be gone.
* Changing your interpretation of your past is often just as good as changing your past.
* Truth is that which has predictive power.
* Watch every thought. Always ask, why am I having this thought?
* Love is given, not received.
* You have to surrender, at least a little bit, to be the best version of yourself possible.
* My definition of wisdom is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions. Wisdom applied to external problems is judgment.

# 🌍 Society, Status & Politics

* Wealth creation is an evolutionarily recent positive-sum game. Status is an old zero-sum game. Those attacking wealth creation are often just seeking status.
* The real struggle isn’t proletariat vs bourgeois. It’s between high-status elites and wealthy elites. When their cooperation breaks, revolution.
* The Efficient Markets Hypothesis fails because humans are herd animals, not independent rational actors. Thus the best investors tend to be antisocial and contrarian.
* Don’t debate people in the media when you can debate them in the marketplace.
* Branding requires accountability. To build a great personal brand (an eponymous one), you must take on the risk of being publicly wrong.
* Social media has degenerated into a deafening cacophony of groups signaling and repeating their shared myths.
* Objectively, the world is improving. To the elites, it’s falling apart as their long-lived institutions are flattened by the Internet.
* School, politics, sports, and games train us to compete against others. True rewards — wealth, knowledge, love, fitness, and equanimity — come from ignoring others and improving ourselves.
* Politics is sports writ large — pick a side, rally the tribe, exchange stories confirming bias, hurl insults and threats at the other side.
* Politics is the exercise of power without merit.
* Politics and merit are opposite ends of a spectrum. More political organizations are less productive, have less inequality, and top performers opt out. More merit based organizations have higher productivity, more inequality, and higher odds of internal fracture.
* Signaling virtue is a vice.
* Cynicism is easy. Mimicry is easy. Optimistic contrarians are the rarest breed.
* A contrarian isn’t one who always objects — that’s a confirmist of a different sort. A contrarian reasons independently, from the ground up, and resists pressure to conform.

# 💡 Technology, Science & Progress

* Technology is not only the thing that moves the human race forward, but it’s the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we’re just monkeys playing in the dirt.
* Technology is applied science. Science is the study of nature. Mathematics is the language of nature. Philosophy is the root of mathematics. All tightly interrelated.
* Mathematics is the language of nature.
* The democratization of technology allows anyone to be a creator, entrepreneur, scientist. The future is brighter.
* We evolved for scarcity but live in abundance.

# 💰 Investing, Markets & Crypto

* Smart money is just dumb money that’s been through a crash.
* Investing favors the dispassionate. Markets efficiently separate emotional investors from their money.
* When building a portfolio of investments that can have non-linear outcomes, never sell early. You may be right most of the time, but the one time you’re wrong will cost you most of the returns.
* Society has had multiple stores of value, as none is perfectly secure. Gold, oil, dollars, real estate, (some) bonds & equities. Crypto is the first that’s decentralized *and* digital.
* Crypto is a bet against the modern macroeconomic dogma, which is passed off as science, but is really a branch of politics — with rulers, winners, and losers.

# 🗣️ Communication & Expression

* The secret to public speaking is to speak as if you were alone.
* To be honest, speak without identity.
* Total honesty at all times. It’s almost always possible to be honest & positive.
* Before you can lie to another, you must first lie to yourself.
* Someone who is using a lot of fancy words and big concepts probably doesn’t know what they’re talking about. The smartest people can explain things to a child; if you can’t do that, you don’t understand the concept.
* It’s the mark of a charlatan to try and explain simple things in complex ways and it’s the mark of a genius to explain complicated things in simple ways.
* People who try to look smart by pointing out obvious exceptions actually signal the opposite.

# 🧭 Self, Growth & Priorities

* The people who succeed are irrationally passionate about something.
* Following your genuine intellectual curiosity is a better foundation for a career than following whatever is making money right now.
* The first rule of handling conflict is don’t hang around people who are constantly engaging in conflict.
* If it entertains you now but will bore you someday, it’s a distraction. Keep looking.
* I don’t plan. I’m not a planner. I prefer to live in the moment and be free and to flow and to be happy.
* If you try to micromanage yourself all you’re going to do is make yourself miserable.
* The less you want something, the less you’re thinking about it, the less you’re obsessing over it, the more you’re going to do it in a natural way.
* I don’t have time is just saying it’s not a priority.
* A personal metric: how much of the day is spent doing things out of obligation rather than out of interest?
* We feel guilt when we no longer want to associate with old friends and colleagues who haven’t changed. The price, and marker, of growth.
* People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles can’t fathom.
* So I have no time for short-term things: dinners with people I won’t see again, tedious ceremonies to please tedious people, traveling to places that I wouldn’t go to on vacation.
